# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Neural-Network

This program solves the MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognizer problem with a fully connected feed forward neural network
constructed in Java utilizing back propogation and stochastic gradient descent. The program functions within a menu
interface in a terminal which allows a user to train a new network, open a previously saved network, save a network,
and interact with this network statistically and visually.
