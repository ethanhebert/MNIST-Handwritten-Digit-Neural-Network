# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Neural-Network

This program solves the MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognizer problem with a fully connected feed forward neural network
constructed in Java utilizing back propogation and stochastic gradient descent. The program functions within a menu
interface in a terminal which allows a user to train a new network, open a previously saved network, save a network,
and interact with this network statistically and visually.

## NOTE
MNIST training and testing data are stored inside of `mnist_data.zip` due to the files being too large to be stored on GutHub. You must unzip these files into the same directory as `mnistnn.java` for the program to work properly.
