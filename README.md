# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Neural-Network

This program solves the MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognizer problem with a fully connected feed forward neural network
constructed in Java utilizing back propogation and stochastic gradient descent. The program functions within a menu
interface in a terminal which allows a user to train a new network, open a previously saved network, save a network,
and interact with this network statistically and visually.

## NOTE
MNIST training and testing data are stored inside of `mnist_data.zip` due to the files being too large to be stored on GitHub. You must unzip these files into the same directory as `mnistnn.java` for the program to work properly.

## CSV FILES
Previously trained networks are stored in the CSV files with numbers for their names. The numbers represent the percentage of correct classification of each network. These can be selected from within the program for use.
